# Windows High contrast

When styling for the Windows OS high contrast mode there are only a certain subset of colors that can be used. These
colors are currently [an official part of the CSS working draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#css-system-colors)
but are supported by chromium browsers (i.e. Microsoft Edge) on windows. Below is the list of system colors that
can be used with Fluent UI. These keywords can be used as just like hex color values in CSS.

> Feel free to turn on windows high contrast mode to view the colors for different themes

```css
color: CanvasText;
background-color: Canvas;
```
