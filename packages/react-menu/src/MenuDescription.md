A `Menu` displays a list of actionalble items on a popover surface whose position is configurable.

The visibility of a menu changes through user interactions with
a trigger element, which are configurable to an extent. In most cases the trigger element is a button, but other types of elements can be used.

Multiple menus can be nested so that a menu item can open its own submenu.

When a standard menu item is invoked, the action closes the menu and any other parent menus.

A menu can also contain selectable items with checkbox and radio item behaviours. In cases of selection, the menu is
not closed so that further selections can be made.

Items in a menu can be grouped visually and semantically with groups and dividers.
