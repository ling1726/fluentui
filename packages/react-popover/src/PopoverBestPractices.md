## Best practices

### Do

- Use the `trapFocus` prop when focusable elements are in the `Popover`.
- Create nested `Popovers` as separate components.
- Use `Popover` to reduce screen clutter to host non-essential information.

### Don't

- Don't use more than 2 levels of nested `Popovers`.
- Don't use `Popovers` to display too much content, consider if that content should be on the main page.

### Content

- Use sentence-style capitalizationâ€”only capitalize the first word. For more info, see
  [Capitalization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/capitalization) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.
