The `Overflow` and `OverflowItem` components, are low level utilities that enable users to create overflow
experiences with any component. They components will detect and hide overflowing elements in DOM and manage
the overflow state. Additional overflow hooks can be used to handle overflowing items. In the reference
examples below the overflowing items are handled using a `Menu`.
